# Experiment: Auditory Discrimination (AB)

# Description:
Purpose of this experiment is to measure a participant's ability to
discriminate (speech) sounds. For each trial two sound stimuli are
presented. Participant's task is to indicate which of the two stimuli
are part of the lanuage they previously heard.
Self-paced. Output: chosen value, RT and
correctness.

# Pseudorandomisation
* Participant field `Counterbalance_order_yes_no` enables the swap of the first triplet and second triplet order and also swaps the expected answer.
* No more than two trails in a row of the same type.
